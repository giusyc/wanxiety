#  Software Engineering Career

## Where to start
### Data Structures & Algorithms

To become a software engineer, whether a web developer, a full stack engineer or a backend engineer, you need to be able to pass the coding interview. In order to pass the interview, you need to have a solid knowledge of Computer Science Fundamentals which include Data Structures and Algorithms.
Below are my favorite courses to learn CS Fundamentals:

- <a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science?webview=false&campaign=CS50%27s+Introduction+to+Computer+Science&source=edx&product_category=course&placement_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edx.org%2Fcs50" target="_blank">Harvard's CS50</a>
  - This is handsdown one of the best free CS courses to take. David Malan is a phenomenal professor and in this course you will learn about memory, Data Structures & Algorithms, Big O Notations and many other concepts. You will also code in C, Javascript and Python and create a few different projects.
- <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms" target="_blank">UCSD Data Structures & Algorithms</a>
  - Another awesome free in depth course that will prepare you for a career in Software Engineering or Data Science.
- <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank">Free Code Camp</a>
  - Really good website to learn to code for free and very beginner friendly. They have alot of different courses and certifications and lots of practice questions for software engineering interviews.

## Practice, Practice, Practice

After learning CS Fundamentals, pick one coding language you enjoy and start practicing for the engineering interview. Below are the best resources for interview practice and learning to code really well.

- <a href="https://www.leetcode.com" target="_blank">LeetCode</a>.
 - The preferred website for interview practice. Thousands of questions with tips and answers to help you solve them and learn patterns. I would start with the free account and then pay for premium once you are getting closer to interviews.

- <a href="https://exercism.org/" target="_blank">Exercism</a>.
 - Phenomenal free website with mentoring, full coding courses in many languages and questions to practice Data Structures & Algorithms.

- <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/?kw=data+structures+and&src=sac" target="_blank">JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass</a>
 - This is a paid Computer Science and Coding Interview Bootcamp but it is phenomenal and it will prepare you for the interview.
- <a href="https://www.pramp.com/#/" target="_blank">Pramp</a>.
 - This is great website where you can practice live mock interviews with other people preparing for engineering interviews.

 ## Start scheduling interviews
 Once you feel ready to start interviewing, you should start applying for engineering roles. The best way to look for openings are by going on Linkedin and other careers websites, or if there is a company you really want to work for, go on their website and see what roles they have open.
