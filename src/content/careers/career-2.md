# Path to Being a Lawyer

If you want to choose a lawyer career path, forget everything you saw on TV (Suits, Law & Order, My Cousin Vinny). Most shows sensationalize the profession without giving credence to reality. Being a lawyer can be very fulfilling if you choose the subject matter and the industry you are passionate about. Especially in the beginning, lawyering involves long hours, high stress, unruly clients, and other counsel/judges.
