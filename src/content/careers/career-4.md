# Overview
Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence are buzzwords of the modern day, but it is also important before we dive into this
to distinguish between the two. Machine Learning can be seen as the core of what this discipline is; where a machine uses
statistics, models and algorithms to adaptively solve problems. Artificial Intelligence can be seen as a layer above in
which we include aspects such as speech, vision, and more senses to detect more complex patterns.
The following lays out a pathway for ML/AI mastery.

# Path to Mastery
## Prerequisite: Python

Majority of AI/Machine Learning approaches are predominantly done in Python (Some are in C++ too for more performance critical cases).
As a result learning Python should be a primary focus on this path. There are a vast amount of resources online to learn Python, but I recommend
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBxCHonP6Ro&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC_" target="_blank">thenewboston</a>.

In terms of frameworks there are two primary players in this field and that is Tensorflow and PyTorch. The path I recommend although starts in Tensorflow 
I believe the skills directly are transferable to PyTorch as really the underlying concepts are what are most important over the framework.

## Prerequisites: Mathematics
You don't need to be an expert in these starting out but these are necessary to understand to make Machine Learning.
For math courses I recommend <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/kristaking/" target="_blank">Krista King</a> on Udemy for gaining those foundations:
- <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/integralcalc-algebra/" target="_blank">Algebra</a>
- <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/statistics-probability/" target="_blank">Statistics</a>
- <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/linear-algebra-course/" target="_blank">Linear Algebra</a>
- <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/calculus1/" target="_blank">Basic Calculus</a>

It is important to note that Udemy frequently runs sales that will make courses significantly cheaper so it's wise to always wait for a sale before purchasing.

## Machine Learning Specialization:
One of the most useful places I feel to start is hands down the Machine Learning Specialization given by Andrew Ng from DeepLearning.ai that can be found
through Coursera: Specialization link <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction?" target="_blank">here</a>.

This gives you the foundational tools to understand and apply Machine Learning algorithms. Which will act as the foundation for more complex
concepts such as Deep Learning.

## Deep Learning Specialization:
The next step in this path I recommend in this path is the Deep Learning Specialization (also offered by DeepLearning.ai) through Coursera:
Specialization link <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?">here</a>.

By gaining this knowledge in Deep Learning you have a much more formidable position to be considered for AI Engineering.
Many new use cases for AI also become available at your disposal through this specialization and therefore you can branch out into a variety of
industries.

## Deeplearning.ai & Branching Out

Once the foundations are set with those two specializations there are many different directions you can go. Here are some recommended paths:
### <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai">Deeplearning.ai</a>

Deeplearning.ai offers a multitude of courses from various different sources you can utilize to develop a more specialized skill set.

### <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice?">Tensorflow Specialization</a>

This course series reinforces what you learn in Deep Learning and is more hands on with Tensorflow which is good for reinforcing what you have previous learned
as well as applying everything thoroughly.

### <a href="https://www.kaggle.com">Kaggle</a>

Kaggle is an excellent resource for learning Data Science as well as putting your skills to the test. You can do various things here from publishing/finding datasets, learning more concepts, discovering models, doing challenges,
competing in competitions (some with cash prizes too.) This is a great platform to contribute to and get your name out there.

## Alternate Routes
Here are some other resources that can be utilized to accelerate your career in this field

### <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer">IBM AI Engineer Specialization</a>

While the other Deep Learning Path focused on Tensorflow, this path focuses more on PyTorch which is an alternative to Tensorflow. Note this is a course that jumps right into
Deep Learning so if you want a foundation of understanding the Machine Learning Specialization should still be done first. A benefit of this specialization as well is that it is
an IBM Certification.

### Udemy AI A-Z Courses

These are some extensive additional courses that can be utilized as well, 
- <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/" target="_blank">Machine Learning A-Z</a>
  - Provides learning for R
  - Extensive Machine Learning coverage
- <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/" target="_blank">Deep Learning A-Z</a>
  - Covers several Deep Learning subjects
  - Short course (23 hours) 
- <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/artificial-intelligence-az/" target="_blank">AI + LLM A-Z</a>
  - Offers resources for teaching LLM Implementation
  - Short course (15 hours)

### Stanford Lectures: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGwO_UgTS7I&list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU" target="_blank">CS229</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PySo_6S4ZAg&list=PLoROMvodv4rOABXSygHTsbvUz4G_YQhOb" target="_blank">CS230</a>

If you prefer lectures instead of a course style outline, Stanford offers free lectures on YouTube (also taught by Andrew Ng):

CS229: This playlist has 20 lectures making it a really extensive free series for Machine Learning. 

CS230: This playlist has 10 lectures and goes through core concepts of Deep Learning.
