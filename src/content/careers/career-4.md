# AI/ML Engineering

Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence are buzzwords of the modern day, but it is also important before we dive into this
to distinguish between the two. Machine Learning can be seen as the core of what this discipline is; where a machine uses 
statistics, models and algorithms to adaptively solve problems. Artificial Intelligence can be seen as a layer above in
which we include aspects such as speech, vision, and more senses to detect more complex and intrinsic patterns.

## Path to Mastery

### Prerequisite: Python

Majority of AI/Machine Learning approaches are predominantly done in Python (Some are in C++ too for more performance critical cases).
As a result learning Python should be a primary focus on this path. There are a vast amount of resources online to learn Python, but I recommend

### Machine Learning Specialization:
One of the most useful places I feel to start is hands down the Machine Learning Specialization given by Andrew Ng from DeepLearning.ai that can be found
through Coursera: Specialization link <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction?" target="_blank">here</a>.

This gives you the foundational tools to understand and apply Machine Learning algorithms. Which will act as the foundation for more complex
concepts such as Deep Learning.

### Deep Learning Specialization:
The next step in this path I recommend in this path is the Deep Learning Specialization (also offered by DeepLearning.ai) through Coursera:
Specialization link <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?">here</a>.

By gaining this knowledge in Deep Learning you have a much more formidable position to be considered for A.I. Engineering.
Many new use cases for A.I. also become available at your disposal through this specialization and therefore you can branch out into a variety of
industries.
